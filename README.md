# Place Pictures


## Description

Place Pictures is a program that allows you to play with any of your pictures. Just like you played with figures when you were a child. The only limit is your fantasy. 

Find nice big background image and open it. The background picture can represent a landscape or anything else. Find nice picture files representing figures or anything else and place it on the background image. You can move pictures. Use your own imagination to imagine what is being done. You can imagine and play wars and fights or any other scenario.

This project is intended to cause fun.
